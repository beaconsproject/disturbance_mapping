# Regional disturbance mapping

The goal of the regional disturbance mapping project is to develop and validate a regional-scale disturbance map for a pilot planning region in southeast Yukon and northwest BC that can be used for conservation and land use planning. Our specific objectives are to:

- Develop regional disturbance maps using existing datasets
- Identify spatial and temporal gaps in disturbance maps
- Fill gaps in coverage using remote sensing imagery (digitizing)
- Validate and update disturbance maps using high resolution remote sensing and field based data
- Develop value-added products:
  - [Regional Disturbance Mapping Explorer](https://github.com/beaconsproject/RDMExplorer)

## Disturbance datasets

A number of existing disturbance and related existing datasets exist in both Yukon and British Columbia. We are currently compiling a list of the most relevant datasets:

- Yukon datasets
- BC datasets

## Protocol for manual disturbance mapping

The third objective of the Regional Disturbance Mapping project is to fill gaps in the coverage of disturbances using high resolution remote sensing imagery. The procedures to do so were adapted from the YG Government Surface Disturbance Mapping protocol and are described here:
