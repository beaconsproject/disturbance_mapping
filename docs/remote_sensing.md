# Map products derived from remotely sensed data

Updated: 2023-05-16

Map products derived from remotely sensed data are increasingly available. On this page we provide a list of (mostly) anthropogenic disturbance map products.

## Canada

### National Terrestrial Ecosystem Monitoring System for Canada

This is one of the main sources of map products available at a national scale. Most of the datasets are derived from 30-m Landsat imagery. The datasets can all be downloaded directly from the link below or via Google Earth Engine (GEE) at the links provide under each dataset.
